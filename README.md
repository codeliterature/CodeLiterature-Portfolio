# MagiTech-Portfolio
MagiTech is a portfolio site of organisation named, MagiTech. <br/>
As a newly initiated organization composed two newbie programers it is currently unavailable and not interested in work related to business.<br/>
Through this site you can keep track of our progress, the projects we make, the things we learn and also contact through the links and connections provided.<br/>
Please note that MagiTech is relatively new and yet to fully integrate in this programming world, so any mistake they make, pointing it out and helping is always appreciated.<br/>
Aside from that MagiTech belives in its own motive and drive to learn and self improvement, so please keep watching over us.
